<div class="content2"><p><h> Instructions:</h><br>
    1. Heat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour three 8-inch round cake pans, or line them with parchment paper.<br>
    
    2. Prepare the cake batter:<br>
       - In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy using a hand mixer or stand mixer.<br>
       - Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.<br>
       - Stir in the vanilla extract and scraped vanilla bean seeds (or vanilla bean paste).<br>
    
    3. Combine dry ingredients:<br>
       - In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.<br>
    
    4. Alternate mixing:<br>
       - Gradually add the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture, alternating with buttermilk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined after each addition, being careful not to overmix.<br>
    
    5. Bake the cakes:<br>
       - Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans.<br>
       - Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.<br>
       - Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing them to cool completely on wire racks.<br>
    
    6. Prepare the frosting:<br>
       - In a large bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy.<br>
       - Gradually add the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, mixing well after each addition.<br>
       - Add the vanilla bean seeds (or paste) and a pinch of salt.<br>
       - Add heavy cream (or milk) as needed to achieve a spreadable consistency. Beat until light and fluffy.<br>
    
    7. Assemble the cake:<br>
       - Place one cake layer on a serving plate or cake stand.<br>
       - Spread a layer of frosting on top.<br>
       - Repeat with the remaining cake layers, spreading frosting between each layer and on top and sides of the cake.<br>
    
    8. Decorate (optional):<br>
       - Decorate the top of the cake with sprinkles, edible glitter, or fresh berries for a festive touch.<br>
    
    9. Serve and enjoy!<br>
       - Slice and serve the cake at room temperature.<br>
